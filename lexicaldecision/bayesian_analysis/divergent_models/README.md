The purpose of this folder is to document the posterior predictive checks that

were obtained with the initial models. Since these checks revealed major 

divergences between the observed and the predicted data, the models were rerun 

with more iterations and without random slopes for covariates. It was not 

necessary to reduce the random-effects structure as a very large number of 

iterations were run, totalling 90,000 post-warmup draws.
