The power curves are being rerun using the final model from the 'frequentist_analysis' folder. 

Since the latter model is nearly identical to the initial one, the final power 

curves are not expected to differ much. Once completed, the scripts and the 

results for the power curves will be updated.


# Numbered power curves

The number assigned to each power curve serves refers to the effect 

that was examined in each case. Using these numbers allows for 

shorter fileÂ names.
