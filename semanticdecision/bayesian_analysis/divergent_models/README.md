The purpose of this folder is to track the futile efforts undertaken to 

have the models converge. Specifically, new models were run that 

contained twice as many iterations as the models stored in 

'bayesian_analysis/results'. In spite of this increase, convergence 

was not reached. The models summaries are available in the 'results' 

subfolder (the weakly-informative prior model is not present because 

it was cancelled once the two other models finished and presented 

major divergences). All R-hat values far exceeded 1.30 (values larger 

than 1.01 are problematic; Vehtari et al., 2021, https://doi.org/10.1214/20-BA1221).
